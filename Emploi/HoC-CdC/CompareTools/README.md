1.1 For each folder, I add a ***README.md*** to help understand how each files in the folders works.

1.2 To allow the script to work as expected, you will need this file architecture:
```
[RootDirectory]:.

└───CompareTool
    │
    ├───'FoldersComparison' or 'ApplicationsComparison'
    │   ├───...                ├───...
    │   └───README.md          └───README.md
